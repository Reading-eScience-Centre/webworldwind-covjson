TODO:

1) create UI for different verticle axis.

Completed:

- Extract and load values for different
  time scales.

- Refractored to separate out the different logic of the time UI and
  legend into different classes.

- Tablet friendly

- prettify legend with boarder plus other css modifications.

- Created a managing class for sorting though multiple UIs.
